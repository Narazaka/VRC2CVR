## Caution!

The author of this tool does not fully understand VRChat's "AnimationOverride", so there may be mistakes in the conversion of override. Pull requests are welcome!

## Renamed!

There was an existing tool called https://github.com/ZettaiVR/VRC2CVR, which had a same name, so I renamed it to VRC2CVR-YA (although the code is still all VRC2CVR because it is just a product name). This tool is easier to use for migrating existing avatars because the original one requires deleting the VRCSDK.
